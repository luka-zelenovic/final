**Germoscope** is a student project built during the Creative Coding course at the Politecnico di Milano. 

**About the project:**

Germoscope is first of all a simplified, digital simulation of a microscope. We created “Germoscope” because we wanted a visual representation of the presence of bacteria on the surfaces of everyday. We wanted to do it with the help of a commonly used smartphone instead of a professional microscope. In our work we use the word “germ” but actually we focus only on bacteria, bypassing viruses and fungi. According to the research on which theoretical basis of our app is built. We decided to show four main bacteria phylas that are the most common regardless of the type of surface being tested: Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fimicutes and Bacteroidetes. We also chose bacteria because of the part of the project referring to antibacterial cleaning products. This part of the project focuses on cleaning tools and the way they remove bacteria. We choose four different types of cleaning product (Soap, Ammonia, Alcohol and Vinegar+Baking Soda) to show the differences between them and to understand better the way how they remove/ kill bacteria.
